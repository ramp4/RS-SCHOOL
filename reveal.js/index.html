            What is CSS Grid Layout?
            <aside class="notes">
              Hello, my name is Artem and today we gona talk about CSS Grid Layout. So, What is CSS
              Grid layout?

            CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to
            do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS
            has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of
            it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these
            methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical
            centering, for instance).

            Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex
            two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid actually work very well together). Grid is the
            very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been
            hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites.

          <section>How to work with Grid?
            <aside class="notes">How to work with Grid?</aside>

          </section>
          <section>
            To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with
           display: grid
            , set the column and row sizes with
            grid-template-columns
            and
            grid-template-rows
            , and then place its child elements into the grid with
           grid-column
            and
           grid-row
            . Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can
            place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media
            queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely
            rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of
            CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.

          <section>Important Terminology

          <aside class="notes">Before diving into the concepts of Grid it's important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse them with one another if you don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don't worry, there aren't many of them.</aside>

                            Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px. In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-content which aligns the grid along the inline (row) axis).
